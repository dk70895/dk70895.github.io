	<p> The Polar Bear is undoubtedly the best <del>bird</del> bear. Besides being capable of flight, Polar Bears have laser vision that can melt steel beams. Not all Polar Bears drink Coca-Cola. That is a harmful media stereotype. </p>

	<p>I am a Polar Bear. My name is Peter... Peter Polar Bear... No Paul Polar Bear... No... No... Patrick??? That's not it. Wait I remember, I'm just a Bear. Bears don't have names. That's enough about me though. Let's get down to business. </p>
	
	<p> Climate change is <i>real</i>. Global surface temperatures are expected to rise between .3C&deg;-4.8C&deg; by the end of the century. I'm really excited. I can't wait. I'll be wearing my swim shorts year round. I'll sit by the pool with a margarita in December. Wait... That doesn't sound right. Oh yeah, I live on an iceberg. I'm probably going to die. </p>

	<p> So this is no joke kids. In order to save us Polar Bears, you're going to have to get serious about climate change. Do whatever you can to cool down the Earth. I recommend running your air conditioner. Actually, just buy some industrial sized air conditioners and run them 24/7. </p>
